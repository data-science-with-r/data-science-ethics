That is, calculate the percentages of public sector, private sector, don’t know for each of the services and check that they match the percentages from the plot.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Create an improved version of the visualization. Your improved visualization:\n\n- should also be a segmented bar chart with services on the y-axis and presented in the same order as the original plot; sectors should create segments of the plot using the same colors (`gray`, `#FF3205`, and `#006697`) and appear in the same order as the original plot\n\n- should have the same legend location\n\n- should have the same title and caption\n\n- does not need to have a bolded title or a gray background\n\n- does not need to show percentages in the segments\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   How does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?\n\nAdd response here.\n",
