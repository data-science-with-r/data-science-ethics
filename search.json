Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. […] We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology. The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology."

    "text": "Fixing the graph\nNow that we have identified how this graph is misleading, let’s create our own graph that fixes the issue! The first thing we need to do is think about the structure of our data. As seen above, our three column names are date, mask mandate, and no-mask mandate.\n\nHow do the structure of these data need to change in order for us to plot these data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values of mask mandate and no-mask mandate need to be levels of a categorical variable that we can map to the visual element (lines) on our plot. In the following code below, we name this variable County.\n\nkansas_covid |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(!date, names_to = \"County\" , values_to = \"cases\") \n\n# A tibble: 46 × 3\n   date      County          cases\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 7/12/2020 mask mandate     25.2\n 2 7/12/2020 no-mask mandate   9.8\n 3 7/13/2020 mask mandate     19.7\n 4 7/13/2020 no-mask mandate   9.2\n 5 7/14/2020 mask mandate     19.7\n 6 7/14/2020 no-mask mandate   9.4\n 7 7/15/2020 mask mandate     20.4\n 8 7/15/2020 no-mask mandate   9.8\n 9 7/16/2020 mask mandate     19.7\n10 7/16/2020 no-mask mandate   9.9\n# ℹ 36 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that our data is in the correct format (note that we also changed our date variable to be in the format of month, day, year), we are going to use ggplot(), and the appropriate geom function to make our new graph. Please see the Function Reference for the different types of geoms we can use. Add the appropriate geom to the plot below to make a line graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can use geom_line() to create a line graph!\n\nkansas_covid |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(!date, names_to = \"County\" , values_to = \"cases\") |&gt;\n  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = \"%m/%d/%Y\")) |&gt;\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = date , y = cases , color = County)\n  ) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing our new graph, what proper conclusion can we make?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on our new graph, we can see the Kansas Covid-19 7 day rolling averages per/100k between the dates of 7/12/2020 through 8/03/2020 decreased for the mask mandated counties, and stayed relatively consistent for the non-masked mandated counties. We can also see that within this date range, the non-mask mandated counties had a lower rolling average per/100k than masked mandated counties.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add the following lines of code to make the graph even more effective. We are using scale_color_manual() to change the colors of the line associated with the County variable; scale_x_date()to add date labels to the x-axis; theme()to change the angle of the x-axis and the position of the legend; and labs() to add a title! We also have given a subset of dates, and removed having an angled x-axis to improve readability for the user."

Hall) show a more cyclic pattern than an overall downward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of your overall takeaways after working with these two misleading graphs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\n\n\n– We digest information from graphs very quickly. If data are misrepresented, it may not be initially obvious, leading to some making incorrect conclusions.\n– Data cane be manipulated based on their axes. If you are creating / consuming graphed information, it’s important to be cognizant of the scale and order in which information on the axes are in.\n– Plotting data in a unfamiliar way (ex. having two y-axes) can be misleading, instead of a helpful comparison tool. As a researcher, think critically about how your audience is going scan your visualization."
