Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. […] We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology. The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology."

As seen above, the three variables in the data are date, mask mandate, and no-mask mandate.\n\nHow do the structure of these data need to change in order for us to plot these data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values of mask mandate and no-mask mandate need to be levels of a categorical variable that we can map to a visual element (lines) on our plot.\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s do this!\n\nReshape the data so that it’s longer with three columns: date, mandate, and cases. Save the resulting data frame as kansas_covid_longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider using the pivot_longer() function:\nkansas_covid_longer &lt;- kansas_covid |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = ___,\n    names_to = ___,\n    values_to = ___\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nWe want to pivot all columns but the date column:\nkansas_covid_longer &lt;- kansas_covid |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !date,\n    names_to = ___,\n    values_to = ___\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe columns names should go to a column called mandate:\nkansas_covid_longer &lt;- kansas_covid |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !date,\n    names_to = \"mandate\",\n    values_to = ___\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values should go to a column called cases:\nkansas_covid_longer &lt;- kansas_covid |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = !date,\n    names_to = \"mandate\",\n    values_to = \"cases\"\n  )\n\nkansas_covid_longer\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that our data is in the correct shape, let’s also address the data type of the date variable.\n\nTransform the date column of the kansas_covid_longer data frame to be a variable that R recognizes as a date. Save the resulting data frame with the updated date variable as kansas_covid_longer again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can use the mdy() function from the lubridate package which is already loaded with tidyverse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’re transforming a column, so use the mutete() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 3\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting the first two hints together:\nkansas_covid_longer &lt;- kansas_covid |&gt;\n  ___(date = ___(date))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nkansas_covid_longer &lt;- kansas_covid_longer |&gt;\n  mutate(date = mdy(date))\n\nkansas_covid_longer\n\n\n\n\n\nOur data frame is ready to be plotted! Next, we’ll use ggplot(), and the appropriate geom function to make our new graph.\n\nRecreate a slightly improved version of the original plot with date on the x-axis, cases on the y-axis, and data represented in lines colored by mandate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease see the ggplot2 function reference for help with determining the appropriate geom for making a line plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appropriate geom is geom_line():\nggplot(\n  kansas_covid_longer,\n  aes(x = ___ , y = ___ , color = ___, group = ___)\n  ) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting everything together together:\nggplot(\n  kansas_covid_longer,\n  aes(x = date , y = cases , color = mandate, group = mandate)\n  ) +\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing our new visualization, what proper conclusion can we make?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on our new graph, we can see the Kansas COVID-19 7 day rolling averages per/100k between the dates of July 12, 2020 through August 3, 2020 decreased for the mask mandated counties, and stayed relatively consistent for the non-masked mandated counties. We can also see that within this date range, the non-mask mandated counties had a lower rolling average per/100k than masked mandated counties.\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s improve the visualization further:\n\nUse scale_color_manual() to change the colors of the lines associated with the mandate variable.\nUse scale_x_date()to change the breaks and labels of the x-axis.\nUse labs() to modify a axis labels and the label of the legend as well as add a title and a subtitle.\nUse theme_bw() to make the plot black-and-white themed.\nMove the legend inside of the plot, 90% of the way on the x-axis and 80% of the way on the y-axis, and draw a gray rectangle around it.\n\n\nRun the code below to generate the plot with the improvements described above. Then, modify various pieces of the code and re-run it to observe the effect and to help you understand what each function does."

Further, some counties (ex. Hall) show a more cyclic pattern than an overall downward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of your overall takeaways after working with these two misleading graphs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe digest information from graphs very quickly. If data are misrepresented, it may not be initially obvious, leading to some making incorrect conclusions.\nData cane be manipulated based on their axes. If you are creating / consuming graphed information, it’s important to be cognizant of the scale and order in which information on the axes are in.\nPlotting data in a unfamiliar way (ex. having two y-axes) can be misleading, instead of a helpful comparison tool. As a researcher, think critically about how your audience is going scan your visualization."
