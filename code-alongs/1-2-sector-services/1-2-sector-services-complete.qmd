# Introduction

## Goal

The following chart was [shared](https://x.com/GraphCrimes/status/1566264004288331776) by @GraphCrimes on X/Twitter on September 3, 2022.

Our ultimate goal in this code along is to identify aspects of misrepresentation in this plot and then to correct them.

## Packages

We will use the **tidyverse** package for data wrangling and visualization.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data

These data come from [Survation](https://www.survation.com/) and were recreated from the percentages noted on the segmented bar chart above.

```{r}
#| label: load-population-data
#| message: false
survation <- read_csv("https://data-science-with-r.github.io/data/survation.csv")
```

Let's take a look at the data.

```{r}
#| label: view-survation-data
survation
```

# Analysis

## Critique

What is misleading about this graph?

The graph is misleading because the segments are not to scale (e.g., making it seem like the difference between public, private, and don't know are closer than the data shows).

## Recreate and improve

-   Confirm that the data match the percentages from the visualization. That is, calculate the percentages of public sector, private sector, donâ€™t know for each of the services and check that they match the percentages from the plot.

```{r}
#| label: calculate-percentages
survation_longer <- survation |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -ID,
    names_to = "service",
    values_to = "sector"
  )

survation_longer |>
  count(service, sector) |>
  group_by(service) |>
  mutate(prop = round(n / sum(n), 2))
```

-   Create an improved version of the visualization. Your improved visualization:

- should also be a segmented bar chart with services on the y-axis and presented in the same order as the original plot; sectors should create segments of the plot using the same colors (`gray`, `#FF3205`, and `#006697`) and appear in the same order as the original plot

- should have the same legend location

- should have the same title and caption

- does not need to have a bolded title or a gray background

- does not need to show percentages in the segments

```{r}
#| label: recreate
survation_longer |>
  mutate(
    service = fct_relevel(
      service, "Royal Mail", "Energy", "Water", "Rail"
    ),
    sector = fct_rev(
      fct_relevel(sector, "Public sector", "Private sector", "Don't know"))
    ) |>
  ggplot(aes(y = service, fill = sector)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray", "#FF3205", "#006697")) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    fill = NULL,
    title = "Do you think the following services should be\nrun in the private sector or the public sector?",
    caption = "Base: All Respondents Unweighted Total: Total=1858"
  )
```

-   How does the improved visualization look different than the original? Does it send a different message at a first glance?

Yes, the improved visualization sends a much different message. Now, at first glance, it is more obvious that, regardless of service, most individuals voted that they should be handled in the public sector instead of the private or don't know. Before, the differences within sector were less obvious due to poor scaling.
