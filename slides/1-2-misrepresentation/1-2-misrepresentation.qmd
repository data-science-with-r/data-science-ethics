# Overview

## Misrepresenting data science results

Some common ways people do this, either intentionally or unintentionally, include:

::: incremental
-   Claiming **causality** where it's not in the scope of inference of the underlying study

-   Distorting **axes and scales** to make the data tell a different story

-   Visualizing **spatial areas instead of human density** for issues that depend on and affect humans

-   Omitting **uncertainty** in reporting

## Original study

Moore, Steven C., et al. [**"Association of leisure-time physical activity with risk of 26 types of cancer in 1.44 million adults."**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2521826) JAMA internal medicine 176.6 (2016): 816-825.

-   **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year.
-   Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more.
-   Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
-   Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

# Uncertainty

  rate     = c(45.3, 44.5, 10.2)
) |>
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "No", "Yes", "No answer"))

ggplot(catalan, aes(y = fct_rev(response), x = rate, color = response, group = response)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(
      x = 0, xend = rate,

    ),
    linewidth = 2
